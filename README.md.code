## DISCLAIMER

This code skeleton is populated by gemini-cli from original codebase. This would have many gaps and missing codes. This is just to give idea and make sense of **component notes**.

As this architecture is generic and able to plug-in different models and components to solve different problems, this skeleton is just to help with idealisation.
