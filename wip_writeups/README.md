## Disclaimer

If you are interested in the story behind it, or the paint point and problem i'm trying to address in this repo, this directory is for you. 

Story is where all things started. It could have a little outdated info as I intended to use FLOWR at the start, but ended up using Pocket2mol. Pipeline steps and flow were changed a little during the actual development and testing, but logic, problem and solution stay the same. 

Blog and Paper are my wish list for now, i'll be updating more in these weeks.

If you want to learn about observations on gaps and possible improvements of this experiment, please look in observation notes.
